This project is a work in progress and we welcome any help. Check out the phases below and see how you might like to be involved.

All contributions will require a pull request. Please be respectful of everyone, and don't submit spammy PRs. This is a translation app, but we don't just want Google translate - we can get that from Google. We need to accurately be able to translate dietary requirements and allergies so that people don't get sick, or worse. Google translate does a  good job, but it's not perfect. If you do review or add a new language, can you please ensure it's added to the [list of supported languages](https://github.com/mishmanners/mish-friendly-food#supported-languages) as part of your pull request.

As for the database itself; categories are being used for when people group multiple things together. Translation is used for individual words being translated and includes synonyms. For example, "dairy" is translated to "lactose" in some countries, but not in others. So we need to be able to translate both "dairy" and "lactose" to the same word in the other language. The dietary_restrictions section is for the actual dietary restrictions and allergies. This is needed so we can translate the words accurately.
