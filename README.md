Mish Friendly Food will translate your dietary requirements/allergies into any language. Once you have your translation, you can get it printed on a cute card. Next time you travel to foreign country, you can pull out your physical or digital card and rest assured that your waiter, host, or chef, will know how to cater for you.

## About

### Why Mish Friendly Food?

People with dietary restrictions and allergies should be able to travel and still eat!

I have a lot of dietary restrictions, and EVERY time I travel, I get into situations where people from other countries (and especially other languages), don't know what I'm talking about or what I'm allergic to. Google translate is great at translating some things, but it lacks depth. For example, in some parts of the world, it isn't known what gluten is. In others, "dairy" :cow: is something completely different than in my own country.

After talking (mostly constructively complaining) about this issue, I discovered I wasn't alone. So we came up with this idea to help us all while we travel. I wanted to name it something cool, but everyone said "go with Mish Friendly Food". This stuck, especially since most of my community already call the food I eat "Mish-friendly". At one conference in particular, one of the organisers even thought "Mish friendly" was actually a dietary type, in the same way "vegan friendly" or "coealic friendly" is. This prompted us to have a website to cater to the "Mish friendly" search criteria, but also help all those people who - like me - struggle when I go travelling.

### Contribution Guidelines

This project is a work in progress and I welcome any help. Check out the phases below and see how you might like to be involved.

All contributions will require a pull request. Please be respectful of everyone and don't submit spammy PRs. This is a translation app, but we don't just want Google translate - we can get that from Google. We need to accurately be able to tranlate dietary requirements and allergies so that people don't get sick, or worse. Google translate does a  good job, but it's not perfect.

## Project stages

The project will run in a few stages. Any help along the way is appreciated.

### Phase 1 - Building the Database

Firstly, to get this underway I need to build the database.

It will consist of the dietary groups such as "dairy, gluten, vegan, vegetarian" etc. The database will also include individual foods, such as pistachio, cashews, banana, mango, potato, etc. I am also wanting to including things like "also known as"; for example, rockmelon and cantelope. The database should also include groups such as tree nuts, meat, etc. which can be assigned to each of the individual foods.

Once the basic database is there, we need people with authority (ie. people who know the language) to translate it into other languages.

### Phase 2 - Translate

Now we'll need to build the app capability to actual translate the database. Users should be able to submit their data in two ways:

- tick boxes (ie. gluten free)
- text dump

Once the user has submitted the data, they should get a result back in their desired language. This can be shown on the screen as text.

### Phase 3 - Beautify and export

People will want to be able to export their translations into cute cards. There should be a blank card as well as a couple of basic artistic styles to choose from. Users should be able to change the font colour and size and finally export their image as a *.png, *.jpeg, *.pdf.

I'll also take any other crazy ideas too - put them in the issue (to be opened)
