# Mish Friendly Food

Do you have dietary requirements or allergies? Love to travel? :airplane: Then you'll :heart: this app.

Mish Friendly Food will translate your dietary requirements/allergies into any language. Once you have your translation, you can get it printed on a cute card. Next time you travel to foreign country, you can pull out your physical or digital card and rest assured that your waiter, host, or chef, will know how to cater for you.

### Contribution Guidelines

This project is a work in progress and I welcome any help. Check out the phases below and see how you might like to be involved.

All contributions will require a pull request. Please be respectful of everyone and don't submit spammy PRs. This is a translation app, but we don't just want Google translate - we can get that from Google. We need to accurately be able to tranlate dietary requirements and allergies so that people don't get sick, or worse. Google translate does a  good job, but it's not perfect.
